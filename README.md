The Anxiety Mapping Model (AMM) is a diagnostic self-reflection framework developed by Alien Algorithms Ltd to help individuals decode, visualize, and manage their anxiety with clarity and autonomy.

Instead of treating anxiety as a singular experience or vague emotional state, AMM breaks it down into clear symptom groupings, trigger-response loops, and dominant frequency patterns — allowing users to identify which type of anxiety they are most likely experiencing, and how to respond accordingly.

AMM is non-clinical, open-source, and designed to be used by anyone — whether you're just beginning to understand your mental health or already in therapy and looking to deepen your insight.

🔍 Core Features
📊 Pattern Recognition:
Map your anxiety across time to detect repeating emotional, cognitive, or physical symptoms.

🧠 Type Identification:
Match dominant symptom clusters to key anxiety types (e.g., survival-based, performance, relational, or existential anxiety).

🛠 Strategy Builder:
Once the type is known, AMM helps you build custom responses using targeted mental and physical techniques.

💡 Trigger Insight:
Connect symptoms to specific life triggers — be it environment, memory recall, sensory input, or social dynamics.

📎 Integration Ready:
AMM can be used standalone or layered with PRM (PTSD Response Map) and DPM (Depression Pattern Model) for multi-dimensional self-mapping.

🧩 Why AMM Is Different
Unlike generic symptom checklists or rigid diagnostic tools, the AMM is built on the principle that awareness precedes control — and that anxiety is not a flaw, but a signal processor built for survival.

AMM is pattern-based, non-pathologizing, and fully user-driven — helping users shift from being overwhelmed by their anxiety to learning its rhythm, and eventually, gaining leverage over it.

🧠 Who Can Use AMM?
Individuals navigating daily or chronic anxiety

People in therapy looking to supplement their self-insight

Mental health advocates and educators

Neurodivergent users seeking structure over ambiguity

Researchers interested in open-source mental modeling tools
